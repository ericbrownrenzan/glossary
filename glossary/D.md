## DaVinci

Event selection and data analysis application. [Project website](http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/davinci/).

## DIRA: Direction angle {#DIRA}

The angle between a line drawn from the «primary vertex:PV» to the decay vertex of the particle and the sum of the 4-momentum of its decay products.
One typically uses the cosine of the direction angle in selections.

## DOCA: Distance Of Closest Approach {#DOCA}

The shortest distance between a pair of tracks.

## DPA: Data Processing & Analysis {#DPA}
